# COM1321--Moive

📌 What's Happening in the Code?
1️⃣ We start with a box (a class) called Main

Think of a class like a big box that holds all our instructions. The name of the box is Main.
This is where we put our instructions for the computer.
2️⃣ Inside the box, we have a special key (main method)

public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
This is like a magic key that tells the computer, "Start reading from here!"
Without this, the computer wouldn’t know where to begin!
3️⃣ Printing Favorite Movie Details (System.out.println(...))

This is like writing a note on paper and showing it to people!
Each System.out.println(...) tells the computer to say something on the screen.
4️⃣ What are we telling the computer to print?

First, we print the favorite quote from the movie.
Then, we print the name of the movie: I'm in Love with a Church Girl.
Next, we say who said the quote: Miles Montego.
Finally, we print the year the movie was released: 2013.
🏁 What Happens When We Run the Code?
When we tell the computer to run this code, it will show this on the screen:

Fav Qoute :Now, I know what people mean when they say, 'I wish I knew then what I know now.' Ain't that the truth? Probably save me a whole lot of pain and suffering.
Name of the Moive:I'm in Love with a Church Girl
Charecter: Miles Montego
Year released :2013


🎉 Simple Way to Think About It:
Think of the Main class as your storybook. 📖
The main method is like opening the first page of the story. 📄
System.out.println(...) is like telling parts of the story aloud. 🗣️
